# R programming 101

__Why learning R?__ R is an extremely versatile open source programming language for statistics and data science. It is widely used in every field where there is dataâ€”business, industry, government, medicine, academia, and so on.

## Getting Ready

### Install R

The first thing you need to do is to install R on your computer from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) site. A step-by-step tutorial on how to install R for Mac and Windows can be found in the following videos

### Install `swirl` and relevant interactive course

`swirl` is a package used for teaching R programming and data science interactively using the R console. To install `swirl` on your computer follows the step-by-step guide provided at this [link](http://swirlstats.com/students.html).

Start `swirl` (__Step 4__) and install the relevant interactice course (__Step 5__) with 

```r
