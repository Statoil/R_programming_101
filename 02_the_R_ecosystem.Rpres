__The `help` function__ can be used to get online help.

# working with special characters
?"+"
?"for"
```

__The `example` function__ can be used to run examples provided in the help entries.

```r
help(args)
# In most of the online help pages there is an Examples section
# with some examples on how to use what we have been searching for
# some examples can be run using the example function

example(args)

# Another example
# 'persp' draws perspective plots of a surface over the xâ€“y plane
example(persp)
```

There are many resources on the Internet and, because of its single-letter name, R is difficult to search for using general-purpose search engines such as Google.

- Searching for more information

    - The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://cran.r-project.org/

    - The R Project's own manuals are available from the R home page, http://www.r-project.org/. See Manuals section.

    - Various R search engines are listed on the R home page. See Search section.

    - The RSeek search engine quite often: http://www.rseek.org/.

    - Stack Overflow

    - The sos package offers highly sophisticated searching of R materials.

- Asking for help

    - R email lists at http://www.r-project.org/mail.html.
